# e-Commerce APP with React JS and Strapi using Redux toolkit and Stripe for the payment

This project is not complete yet but propose a lot of features.

It's an e-commerce APP made with ReactJS for the frontend and with Strapi on the backend.

I used Redux toolkit for the cart gestion.

You can add any collection in strapi and product directly with strapi admin dashboard.

# `login strapi = admin`
# `password strapi = admin`

With a really simple design, the add to cart and checkout is working with a Stripe payment.
