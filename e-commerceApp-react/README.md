# e-Commerce APP with React JS and Strapi using Redux toolkit and Stripe for the payment

This project is not complete yet but propose a lot of features.

It's an e-commerce APP made with ReactJS for the frontend and with Strapi on the backend.

I used Redux toolkit for the cart gestion.

You can add any collection and product in strapi directly with strapi admin dashboard.

### `http://localhost:1337/admin`
### `login strapi = admin`
### `password strapi = admin`

The frontend can be accessed after `npm install` && `npm run start` in this url
### `http://localhost:3000`

With a really simple design, the add to cart and checkout is working with a Stripe payment.

This project it's just a practice of mine with reactJS, strapi and redux.
